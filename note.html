<!-- LESSON 1 HTML  -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE modifies how an element behaves -->
<!-- the href is an atrribute that takes in a link to be webpage,  -->

<!-- pixels : image sizes, video sizes and screen sizes are measured in pixels.  -->
 <!-- border-radius: takes a px measurement
  border-style: solid: gives the border color an accurate color -->
<!-- MARGIN:in CSS,space around an element is called margin -->
<!-- to get a very round shaped circle edges ,divide the height or width of the shape by 2 and give the result to the border-radius,
eg, if the height is 2opx, border-radius will be 10px

<!-- LESSEON 3 TRANSITION, SHADOW -->
<!-- Pseduo-class: adds style to an element in a pseduo state e.g, hover, active are examples of a pseduo styling -->

<!-- Active: this allows to give various design to an element when you click on the element -->

 <!-- opacity: is used to fade out an element, it takes value btwn 0 and 1,1 means the element is in a normal state
by decreasing the value of opacity from 1, the element starts to fade -->

<!-- Transition: it allows to transition between different styles done on an element, it allows the changes done with pseduo class
  eg active and hover to change smoothly, this takes two values, the first values stands for what we want to transition,
  the second is how long the transition will take. MAKE SURE TO PUT THE TRANSITION INSIDE THE BASE CSS STYLE AND NOT INSIDE HOVER -->

<!-- SHADOW:the CSS property for shadow is box-shadow. box-shadow takes in 4 values,first value represent the horizontal of the shadow,
second value is the vertical position of the shadow, the third value makes the shadow blurred, the forth value is the color of the shadow. -->

<!-- rgba: this is a way of setting the opacity of the color, how see through a color can be  -->
