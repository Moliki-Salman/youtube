<!-- LESSON 1 HTML  -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE modifies how an element behaves -->
<!-- the href is an atrribute that takes in a link to be webpage,  -->
<!-- target attribute determines where the link in the href opens in the currrent page or in a new tap,
 by setting the target to _blank makes it open in a new tap -->
<!-- <a href="" target="_blank"></a> -->
<!-- TAB SIZE: go to settings and click on tab sixe to chang the tab size of vscode  -->

<!-- LESSON 2 CSS -->
<!-- pixels : image sizes, video sizes and screen sizes are measured in pixels.  -->
 <!-- border-radius: takes a px measurement
  border-style: solid: gives the border color an accurate color -->
<!-- MARGIN:in CSS,space around an element is called margin -->
<!-- to get a very round shaped circle edges ,divide the height or width of the shape by 2 and give the result to the border-radius,
eg, if the height is 2opx, border-radius will be 10px
] -->

<!-- LESSEON 3 TRANSITION, SHADOW -->
<!-- Pseduo-class: adds style to an element in a pseduo state e.g, hover, active are examples of a pseduo styling -->

<!-- Active: this allows to give various design to an element when you click on the element -->

 <!-- opacity: is used to fade out an element, it takes value btwn 0 and 1,1 means the element is in a normal state
by decreasing the value of opacity from 1, the element starts to fade -->

<!-- Transition: it allows to transition between different styles done on an element, it allows the changes done with pseduo class
  eg active and hover to change smoothly, this takes two values, the first values stands for what we want to transition,
  the second is how long the transition will take. MAKE SURE TO PUT THE TRANSITION INSIDE THE BASE CSS STYLE AND NOT INSIDE HOVER -->

<!-- SHADOW:the CSS property for shadow is box-shadow. box-shadow takes in 4 values,first value represent the horizontal of the shadow,
second value is the vertical position of the shadow, the third value makes the shadow blurred, the forth value is the color of the shadow. -->

<!-- rgba: this is a way of setting the opacity of the color, how see through a color can be  -->

<!-- LESSON 4 Chrome Dev tools and CSS Box Model -->
 <!-- Chrome Dev tools -->
<!--ARROW: on a website, click on inspect and you will see an arrow key beside ELEMENT, when you click  onit
 and then click on anywhere you want to inspect, it highlights the part you click on the HTML element code -->
<!-- HEX: this is another way of measuring COLOR: for example #1d9bf0,
 the first two represent "1d" represents how much red; the second "9b" represent how much green and the last two is 4 how much blue
 NOTE, you can convert HEX to rgb on google using hex to rgb calculator-->

<!-- Computed:  this shows all the final styles applied to an element you are inspecting -->

<!-- CSS BOX MODEL: this allow to add space between elements and also inside the element to make it bigger -->
<!-- Margin: margin can be added to top, bottom, right and left of an elenent using "margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom" -->

<!-- NOTE: its not a good idea to set height and width to a button because we will be forcing the text inside the button inside the  buttton,
 it is always advisable to let the button set by default to accomodate the text set to it. you can get the right spacing inside of a buton using padding. -->

<!-- PADDING: The spacing inside of a button is padding; just like margin, we can set padding in all four directions. "padding-left etc" -->

<!-- NOTE: By default, the browser trys to align the text in diffrent button on the same line,this is becuase browsers were text based -->

<!-- vertical-align: this allows an element to align to the top, you can add this to diffrent element to make them align on the same row -->
