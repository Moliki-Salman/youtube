<!-- LESSON 1 HTML  -->
<!-- ATTRIBUTE modifies how an element behaves -->
<!-- the href is an atrribute that takes in a link to be webpage,  -->
<!-- target attribute determines where the link in the href opens in the currrent page or in a new tap,
 by setting the target to _blank makes it open in a new tap -->
<!-- <a href="" target="_blank"></a> -->
<!-- TAB SIZE: go to settings and click on tab sixe to chang the tab size of vscode  -->

<!-- LESSON 2 CSS -->
<!-- pixels : image sizes, video sizes and screen sizes are measured in pixels.  -->
<!-- border-radius: takes a px measurement
  border-style: solid: gives the border color an accurate color -->
<!-- MARGIN:in CSS,space around an element is called margin -->
<!-- to get a very round shaped circle edges ,divide the height or width of the shape by 2 and give the result to the border-radius,
eg, if the height is 2opx, border-radius will be 10px
] -->

<!-- LESSEON 3 TRANSITION, SHADOW -->
<!-- Pseduo-class: adds style to an element in a pseduo state e.g, hover, active are examples of a pseduo styling -->

<!-- Active: this allows to give various design to an element when you click on the element -->

<!-- opacity: is used to fade out an element, it takes value btwn 0 and 1,1 means the element is in a normal state
by decreasing the value of opacity from 1, the element starts to fade -->

<!-- Transition: it allows to transition between different styles done on an element, it allows the changes done with pseduo class
  eg active and hover to change smoothly, this takes two values, the first values stands for what we want to transition,
  the second is how long the transition will take. MAKE SURE TO PUT THE TRANSITION INSIDE THE BASE CSS STYLE AND NOT INSIDE HOVER -->

<!-- SHADOW:the CSS property for shadow is box-shadow. box-shadow takes in 4 values,first value represent the horizontal of the shadow,
second value is the vertical position of the shadow, the third value makes the shadow blurred, the forth value is the color of the shadow. -->

<!-- rgba: this is a way of setting the opacity of the color, how see through a color can be  -->

<!-- LESSON 4 Chrome Dev tools and CSS Box Model -->
<!-- Chrome Dev tools -->
<!--ARROW: on a website, click on inspect and you will see an arrow key beside ELEMENT, when you click  onit
 and then click on anywhere you want to inspect, it highlights the part you click on the HTML element code -->
<!-- HEX: this is another way of measuring COLOR: for example #1d9bf0,
 the first two represent "1d" represents how much red; the second "9b" represent how much green and the last two is 4 how much blue
 NOTE, you can convert HEX to rgb on google using hex to rgb calculator-->

<!-- Computed:  this shows all the final styles applied to an element you are inspecting -->

<!-- CSS BOX MODEL: this allow to add space between elements and also inside the element to make it bigger -->
<!-- Margin: margin can be added to top, bottom, right and left of an elenent using "margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom" -->

<!-- NOTE: its not a good idea to set height and width to a button because we will be forcing the text inside the button inside the  buttton,
 it is always advisable to let the button set by default to accomodate the text set to it. you can get the right spacing inside of a buton using padding. -->

<!-- PADDING: The spacing inside of a button is padding; just like margin, we can set padding in all four directions. "padding-left etc" -->

<!-- NOTE: By default, the browser trys to align the text in diffrent button on the same line,this is becuase browsers were text based -->

<!-- vertical-align: this allows an element to align to the top, you can add this to diffrent element to make them align on the same row -->

<!-- TEXT -->
<!-- text-align: center : it a CSS property helps you set your text to center, left or right -->
<!-- HOW TO GET YOUR TEXT TO A SECOND LINE: give the element a width to force others to a second line -->

<!-- Line-height:this helps to adjust spacing between lines. -->
<!-- html-entity: used to set special characters like dot -->
<!-- paragraghs have a defult 14px margin set to them. you can adjust any space between p tags by setting the margin -->

<!-- CSS specificity:CSS give more priorityto a class name selector than an element name selector
 -->

<!-- text element: this is an element that is inside a text, when you add a text element in side a specific element inside a  text  it changes
   eg "strong" makes the element bold  -->
<!-- <span></span>: is an element that is generic, it has no style, the span is useful becos, we can give a class. the span helps modify a specific part
of the element without the whole/entire element -->

<!-- void element: they are element that does not have a closing tag like link etc -->

<!-- IMAGES: When you set the width of an image, the height automatically adjust, do not set the height the image will loss its shape-->
<!-- object fit: this is used to set the image to fit in to the height or width of an image in css.  object fit: contain; sets the image to fit into the width set  -->

<!-- LESSON 8: DISPLAY PROPERTY CSS -->
<!-- block element: takes up the entire line eg <p> -->
<!-- in- block element: only takes up the space that it need and not the entire line eg, <img>, <input> -->
<!-- inline element: appears within a line of text eg <strong> -->
<!-- display: inline-block helps put two element on the same line -->
<!-- display: block; makes element to take up the entire line -->
<!-- COMMAND + SHIFT + 4 : takes a screenshot -->
<!-- GOOGLE DRAWING -->

<!-- CSS GRID: Grid is a layput that has rows and columns;
to create a grid , you need2 steps;
1= set display: grid;
2= set how many colums does grid has using: grid-template-columns:100px 100px;
the grid-template-columns takes two values which determines how wide the grid would be the above shows that the grid would
have a width of 100px.
NOTE: WHEN THE COLUMNS HAVE FILLLED THE ROWS,GRIDS TRANSFERS THE REST COLUMNS TO A NEW LINE AND IT RAPSA ROUNND THE NEW ROW
1fr: it means free space: so if i set:  grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr; it means the first column will take 100px while
the second column will takeup the remaining space, the 1 value sets the amount of value of the fr, if we have two or more fr values
eg grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr 1fr; it means the two 1fr will take equal amount of values of the remaining space; or
grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr 2fr : this means the 2fr will take double the remainspace column of 1fr;
-->
<!-- column-gap: set spaces between columns  -->
<!-- row-gap: set spaces between rows -->

<!-- FLEX: unlike grid, flex only takes us the column space by default. Use  2  steps to create a flex .
 1- "display:flex" to set columns and rows to flex
 2- flex-direction: row; displays element property  horizontally
  2b- flex-direction: column; displays element property  vertically
flex: 1is the equivalnet to 1fr in grid; flex: 2 is the equivalnet to 2fr in grid;
  -->
<!-- DIFF BTWN FLEX AND GRID: Grid has rigid layout, while flex is flexible -->
<!-- Justify-content: set how the element are layout horizontally;
 Justify-content: start: is to set element to the left
 Justify-content: end is to set element to the right
 justify-content: center is to set element to the center
 justify-content:space-between:is to give space btwn elements

 justify-content: center; /* centers item horizontally*/
align-items: center; /* centers item vertically*/ -->

<!-- flex-shrink: 0; helps item not to shrink when the adjust the browser, set to zero means no shrink. -->
<!-- width: 0 , makes item shrink-->

<!-- POSITION
 position: static; default setting
 position:fixed;  makes an element to float on another element, or float  above the page -->
<!-- position has 4 properties to move the element around:
 1) top: 10px ; it will make the top of the element to be up to the browser window, it set how far our element its elements to the  browser window ;
 2) left : set element to the left edge of the browswer window;
 3) bottom and 4) right
 HOWEVER: if you set the element to two properties, it makes the element to streach e.g ->
<!-- also, we can also use height and width to resize the element position. if you want to make ir resize able the poisition then use
 top, bottom etc, but if you it to be fixed, then use height and width -->

<!-- BEST PRACTICE: Always add space on the top of your page and its best to use padding-top to set this,padding is better than margin. set paading to body element -->
<!-- position:fixed is fixed to the browser and it doesnt move when the scrow the page -->
<!-- position: absolute is placed on the page and it moves up and down when you scrow thw page -->

<!-- The element of a div below can move on top of an element of a div above; generally the element that is written below will appear in front of elements that are above -->

<!-- z-index:  this determins which element appear in front and behind, by default  is  z-index:0,
 but an element id higher z-index will appear in front;
 SET Z-index of HEADERS TO 100PX : so we can have alot of element in between if our page has alot of layers -->

<!-- NOTE: MOST TIMES, POSITION ABSOLUTE IS USUALLY PLACED INSIDE A POSITION FIXED ,
  whenever a position abolute is placed inside a fixed element , it will be relate to the fixed elements in position fixed i.e not exceed,
  meaning if you set top:0 on absolute, it will set as fixed to the LENGTH OF the position fixed -->

  <!-- position: relative: cause the element to display normally, when you scrow the page it acts normally"
   when position absolute is put on top of position relative, the  item will be  in a fixed position on top of the element that has relative position  and not on top the page and
   position relative causes the entire element to display normally.  -->

<!-- pointer-events: none;/* disables the hover on the tooltip*/ -->

<!-- prevent the text from wraping around the element -->
